<h1>Chapter 1. Introduction</h1>
<p><em>Background and motivation of this work.</em></p>
<p>Ukrainians are living in unprecedented times. War has ravaged the country and it consequences will be far reaching and long lasting. Some of these consequence will have to do with people’s attitudes towards future. Living under constant threat of could make one live in the moment and don’t plan too much ahead, as the future might not come. This phenomenon in behavioral economics is called time discounting<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and it is linked with life outcomes. And the realities of Ukraine is that &lt;migrants, people becoming poorer, disabled, economy is destroyed, uncertainty is as high as ever&gt; all of which affect people’s daily choices. However we know that long-term growth require forward-looking and more patient behavior.</p>
<p><em>Summarize the research problem/question</em></p>
<p>This is where this paper comes in. We want to study how war, through its many manifestations, affects Ukrainian’s temporal discounting.</p>
<p><em>Summarize the proposed approach (methodology you use) to the problem and the results</em></p>
<p>Given a vast complexity of war experiences, in order to establish the effect of war we would have to consider multiple perspectives: influence on physical and mental health, financial situation and financial wellbeing. War doesn’t directly affect temporal discounting, it does so through other processes like perception of one’s safety, physical and mental health, financial situation.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>In this paper we combine tools from economics and psychology, namely MCQ <span class="citation" data-cites="ruggeri2022">(<a href="#ref-ruggeri2022" role="doc-biblioref">Ruggeri et al. 2022</a>)</span>, FWBS <span class="citation" data-cites="consumerfinancialprotectionbureau2017">(<a href="#ref-consumerfinancialprotectionbureau2017" role="doc-biblioref">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 2017</a>)</span>, and SF-12 <span class="citation" data-cites="ware1996">(<a href="#ref-ware1996" role="doc-biblioref">Ware, Kosinski, and Keller 1996</a>)</span> to analyze the relationship between potentially traumatic experiences and temporal discounting .</p>

<p><em>Paragraph about results</em></p>
<p>The extent to which individuals discount the future and whether they discount in a time consistent fashion is an important determinant of their life outcomes. The topic of war effects on mental, physical and financial health has been thoroughly examined. (list papers) In particular …. <list subtopic="" and="" papers=""></list></p>
<p>Even people not directly affected by war, may suffer from its consequences. Military violence doesn’t just affect the mental health of civilians living in conflict zones <span class="citation" data-cites="cesur2013">(<a href="#ref-cesur2013" role="doc-biblioref">Cesur, Sabia, and Tekin 2013</a>)</span>, but also of those who experience it through daily stressors such as changes in physical health and financial situation, the destruction of social networks and the mass displacement of the civilian population <span class="citation" data-cites="miller2010">(<a href="#ref-miller2010" role="doc-biblioref">Miller and Rasmussen 2010</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Artefactual field experiments from zones of natural disaster or conflict also suggest that exposed individuals’ risk preferences are altered (<span class="citation" data-cites="eckel2009">Eckel, El-Gamal, and Wilson (<a href="#ref-eckel2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="voors2012">Voors et al.

<p>However there hasn’t been enough papers focusing on how war affects temporal discounting.</p>
<p>Why temporal discounting? Because it shows how people value the present over the future. It has been found to be positively correlated with _____, which is relevant for Ukraine.</p>
<p>The questions under consideration are</p>
<p>Can sociodemographic variables, such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status, serve as reliable predictors of higher discounting, and how do these factors interact with ongoing traumatic experiences in shaping individuals’ attitudes towards future following adversity? How do levels of discounting differ between individuals residing in Ukraine and those living abroad, and to what degree are these differences statistically significant? What is the relationship between discounting scores and war-related trauma, and to what extent is discounting future driven by the traumatic experiences associated with ongoing conflict? To study these questions we will….</p>
<p>Time (temporal) discounting is the current relative valuation placed on receiving a good or some cash at an earlier date compared with receiving it at a later date (Frederick and Loewenstein 2002). This tendency is often treated as a behavioral anomaly measured by presenting a series of choices that vary values, timelines, framing (for example, gains or losses) and other trade-offs. Responses to these series of lottery questions can be aggregated or indexed in ways that test different manifestations of the anomaly or the threshold at which individuals are willing to change their preferences. Individuals vary in their responses to intertemporal choice, and their revealed discount rates can be used in predicting behavior across other domains. For example, people who discount future hypothetical monetary gains more steeply, preferring smaller sums sooner to larger sums later, tend to also discount non-monetary rewards: food (Duckworth, Tsukayama, and Geier 2010), alcohol (MacKillop et al.&nbsp;2010) and others. There are also studies that find an association between favoring immediate rewards, as in the classic “marshmallow experiments”, with having poorer academic performance, career success, and a higher likelihood of incarceration or having a drug addiction. (Duckworth, Tsukayama, and Geier 2010; Eigsti et al.&nbsp;2006; Mischel, Shoda, and Rodriguez 1989). There have been a vast literature on the effects of natural disasters on choice preferences (Eckel, El-Gamal, and Wilson 2009; Cassar, Healy, and Von Kessler 2017), and some relevant studies on effect of armed conflict experience on, for example, risk aversion in South Korea (Kim and Lee 2014), social, risk and time preferences in Burundi (Voors et al.&nbsp;2012), and on happiness in Ukraine (Coupe and Obrizan 2016). Some studies report that mental health affects discounting _____, others that it doesn’t Subjective mental health has been shown to be positively associated with discounting (Löckenhoff, O’Donoghue, and Dunning 2011) In the context of ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War, studying intertemporal choices of people affected by war can help in creation of policy decisions that will mitigate negative repercussions of exposure to violence and destruction. This is important, because any effects conflict might have on risk aversion, time discounting, or trusting behavior, could substantially affect how people are able to recover from conflicts.. In other words, exposure to violence impacts communities not only through the direct losses they inflict, like physical damage or seizure/destruction of business, but also through people’s willingness to attempt new business ventures, to save, and to work cooperatively. In this research we want to study intertemporal choices of Ukrainians 1.5 years after the onset of full-scale invasion as it relates to experience of war, media usage, and trust in media.</p>

<section id="chapter-2.-theoretical-background-and-hypotheses" class="level1">
<h1>Chapter 2. Theoretical background and hypotheses</h1>
<p>There are several channels through which a serious natural disaster could affect individual preferences. One plausible channel would be through a large negative shock to wealth or income, which in turn would alter preferences. A second channel, connected to the previous one is increased uncertainty, which also affects preferences.. A third channel, from the psychology literature, would be through worsened mental and/or physical health, which are often associated with higher discounting rates. Any or all of these possibilities could affect individual’s preferences. A range of research gives the expectation that natural disasters could affect preferences in these ways. Here, we review that literature as we describe our predictions for the tsunami’s effects on preferences.</p>
<p>To assess financial situation of the population we would need to consider both objective and subjective fin situaion. Objective being reported monthly income, debts, vehicle subjective is measure with an index. (M.O. and Ya.Ye. 2021)</p>
<p>In studying intertemporal choices during wartime there are multiple things to keep in mind. First is that individual preferences are affected in many ways by exposure to violence. For example, physical damage to oneself or family/friends might have a different impact on the person compared to damage to one’s property. Even just witnessing violence, like hearing sirens, explosions, seeing fighting can make people believe that subsequent negative events will happen. A psychology literature suggests that conflicts and natural disasters elicit strong emotions, such as fear, apathy, and anger, which affect our decision making. Finally, people may receive help from neighbors, strangers, the government and non-governmental organizations, in addition to giving help to others. All of these manifestations of war affect an individual’s choices and preferences. To understand which manifestations can best explain the effect we turn to the relevant literature, discussion of which follows below. Firstly, we look at the papers that take a helicopter look on the topic of time discounting.<br>
(Frederick and Loewenstein 2002) lay the foundation of researching anomalies of choice associated with Discounted Utility Theorem. They systematize previous studies and provide methodology for assessing each anomaly: magnitude, gain–loss asymmetry, delay–speedup asymmetry, common difference and subadditivity. Drawing upon (Frederick and Loewenstein 2002) paper (Ruggeri et al.&nbsp;2022) tested generalizability of temporal discounting in 61 countries using 5 choice anomalies. Key findings that are relevant to us are: facing a negative environment makes people prioritize immediate “immediate clarity over future uncertainty” regardless of their income; temporal discounting scores decrease with bigger wealth, except for the wealthiest individuals; individual debt is associated with lower overall temporal discounting. To understand how experience of an inhospitable environment affects human decision-making across various domains we turn to the literature on natural disaster and violent conflicts. (Voors et al.&nbsp;2012) conducted a series of field experiments in rural Burundi to examine the impact of exposure to conflict on social, risk, and time preferences. They find that individuals exposed to violence are more altruistic, more risk-seeking, and have higher discounting. However, in the end they report that the net effect of exposure to violence is unclear, because on the one hand it encourages risk-taking and increases the prosocial behavior, on the other hand it also triggers impatience, which discourages savings and investments. (Cassar, Healy, and Von Kessler 2017) study trust, risk, and time preferences after a tsunami in Thailand. Similarly to (Voors et al.&nbsp;2012), they find that the 2004 tsunami has led to substantial long lasting increases in risk aversion, prosocial behavior, and impatience. In assessing tsunamis impact they considered whether the village was affected, whether the individual or household experienced financial damage, and whether a family member was injured or killed. We will use a similar approach in our paper. (Coupe and Obrizan 2016) look at how war affected happiness in Ukraine. This paper doesn’t study financial decisions and intertemporal discounting, however it was useful in approaching questions about experience of war. Another paper by the same authors (Coupé and Obrizan 2016) which studies violence and political outcomes in Ukraine allows us to categorize damage caused by war. Knowing the potential effects exposure to violence has on human decision making we needed now to apply this insight in our survey, specifically in the Monetary Choice Questionnaire. For this we need to figure out a benchmark - which monetary amount will be salient for our responders, a discount rate, and a time frame. There are many studies that find various discount rates for different time periods and amounts (see (Frederick and Loewenstein 2002) for a review). In general, shorter time periods are associated with higher rates of observed discounting. (Ruggeri et al.&nbsp;2022) uses 10% of median salary as a benchmark, 10% discounting rate and “now-12 months-24 months” time frame. While this study involved Ukraine in 2021, using the same percentage and time will not yield valuable results for us. To understand conditions facing Ukrainians right now, we turn to a paper on Argentina and Britain (Macchia, Plagnol, and Reimers 2018), in which authors use inflation rate in both countries (Britain - low, Argentina - high inflation) to study people’s sensitivity with regards to delay discounting choices. Another study in Zimbabwe (Larochelle, Alwang, and Taruvinga 2014) provides an extreme account of hyperinflation and how it affects people’s wellbeing. As the Russo-Ukrainian war is the most televised war of recent years, we thought about looking into the use of social media and how it relates with discounting. (Shenhav, Rand, and Greene 2017) in their study of temporal discounting found that people who with steeper discounting prefer to consume information that is less complex and multi-faceted, and use short-form social media (e.g.&nbsp;Twitter). Our contribution will lie in explaining how various experiences of war affect people’s discounting and financial decision making.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 1: Higher exposure to war experiences is predictive of higher present bias;</p>
<p>Hypothesis 2: Low FWBS score will be associated with steeper discounting (impatience);</p>
<p>Hypothesis 3: Having debts will be a strong predictor of present bias - ;</p>
<p>Hypothesis 4: People who report that their financial situation has changed for worse will be more likely to choose immediate gains and later losses</p>
</section>
<section id="chapter-3.-experimental-design" class="level1">
<h1>Chapter 3. Experimental design</h1>
<p>To study these hypotheses we conduct a survey largely adapted from (Ruggeri et al.&nbsp;2022). In particular, we made changes to the Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ): benchmark was set to 1600 UAH; discount rate of 30% which reflects annual inflation rate; and a time frame of “now-3 months-12 months”. The survey goes as follows. Participants are given a survey with approximately 30 items. The primary measures involve discrete choices between an immediate gain or payment 1600 UAH and a delayed gain or payment 2080 UAH of either now or in 3 months. All participants see the same baseline items that are worth approximately 10% of the average monthly household income. Subsequent items change the delayed option based on responder’s initial choice, increasing for those who chose the immediate gain, decreasing those that prefer the delayed prospect, and vice-versa for losses/payments. Individuals will be given a score, depending on their answers. In the end we will have a score that will reflect an individual’s preferences. This strategy results in a score of zero for individuals always choosing the delayed amount and 10 for individuals choosing the sooner reward. After MCQ, participants then answer seven items regarding general financial risk and personal economic conditions that have been useful in other behavioral research on choices and economic inequality, and six demographic items: age, education, location. There is also a section on experience of war, before answering which participants were warned that questions might be sensitive and they may not give an answer “Don’t want to answer”. Lastly, there is a section on social media usage and trust in sources of information. The survey was in Ukrainian and ran for 2 weeks. During this time it had collected 73 responses from Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad. Participants were found via convenience sampling by posting about the survey in social media, which is not ideal for this type of study, because it can lead to biased and not representative samples. This being our pilot study we are content with this kind of sample. In the final paper this will be resolved.</p>
<p>3.0 Measuring Temporal Discounting Temporal discounting was assessed with a task adapted from Mitchell (1999) and implemented on a laptop computer using E-prime (version 2.0) experimental software. Participants were asked to make a series of choices between a smaller outcome affecting them immediately and a larger outcome affecting them at some time in the future. For example, they saw the options “gain $5 now” and “gain $7.50 in 90 days” and used the computer keyboard to select one of the options. Each choice was either a choice between an immediate gain versus a delayed gain (henceforth referred to as the “gain condition”) or a choice between an immediate loss versus a delayed loss (“loss condition”). For each outcome valence (gain or loss), the immediate amount of $5 was held constant across trials. There were seven levels of delayed amounts ($4.75, $5.25, $5.50, $6.00, $6.50, $7.00, $7.50) presented at four delays (7, 30, 90, and 180 Days). Each combination of amounts and delays was presented once in the gain condition and once in the loss condition.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="measuring-financial-wellbeing">3.1 Measuring Financial Wellbeing</h2>
<p>with financial wellbeing we want to see</p>
<p>To measure financial well-being, we use both objective and subjective aspects. Objective FWB is measured as the real total household income – the sum of all household income sources net of taxes and deflated by the consumer price index. To evaluate subjective FWB, we use two self-reported variables. The first variable is the “ability to make ends meet” (“AEM”), which is very commonly used to measure financial well-being (Angel et al., 2003; Arber et al., 2014). It takes a value of 1 if the person had enough income to buy food and 0 otherwise. RLMS does not contain questions that can be used to measure this ability to make ends meet. Thus, for the Russian sample we use a variable that measures “financial satisfaction”, which is also used as an indicator of subjective financial well-being in other studies (i.e.&nbsp;Zimmerman, 1995). It takes a value of 1 if the person is satisfied and 0 otherwise. To evaluate how secure a person feels about their financial future, we use the self-reported “expectation about financial well-being” (“FWB”). It takes a value of 1 if the person expects improvements and 0 otherwise. More detailed information about these measures is presented inTable A1in Appendix A. We distinguish between subjective FWB and income, because income alone does not reflect the ability to meet one’s needs (Zimmerman and Katon, 2005) and has a different dynamic to expectations about the financial situation (Angel et al., 2003; Joo and Grable, 2004). Current real income varies with short-term fluctuations in prices and economic activity. Expectations are more sensitive to the arrival of new information about the conflict (including the influence of fake news, information warfare, etc.) and may shape the investment decisions of individuals. This naturally has implications for policymakers. Debts are related to intertemporal discounting (Ikeda and Kang 2015)</p>
</section>
<section id="measuring-health" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="measuring-health">3.2 Measuring Health</h2>
<p>As per the findings of various academic publications, it has been established that the impact of war on mental health and well-being is notably negative, resulting in the manifestation of a range of psychological disorders such as PTSD, depression (Charlson et al., 2019; Gonçalves Júnior et al., 2022; Hendrickx et al., 2019; Osokina et al., 2022; Perkins et al., 2018), and suicidal ideation (Gonçalves Júnior et al., 2022)</p>
<p>Studies of the health of Ukrainian children and adolescents have confirmed that the risk of developing symptoms of depression exists both during the war and in the post-war period (Gonçalves Júnior et al., 2022; Osokina et al., 2022) According to Gonçalves Júnior et al.&nbsp;(2022), military conflicts also worsen the psycho-emotional state of war-affected populations, resulting in negative feelings such as sadness, anger, guilt, or loneliness.</p>
<p>As there are no feasible ways to measure objective health, we measure subjective health with SF-12 (Ware, Kosinski, and Keller 1996), a widely used and well-validated measure which yields separate scores for mental and physical health. Multiple-choice and Likert-type items require participants to rate their general health as well as aspects of mental well-being and functional health. This index was used in relevant research and has shown good results (Löckenhoff, O’Donoghue, and Dunning 2011)</p>
<p>Regarding health, we make a distinction between physical and mental health, because we expect the conflict’s effect on them to be subject to different mechanisms, timing and duration. The effect on physical health may develop later, but with longer and more severe effects, leading to disabilities and chronic diseases (Alderman et al., 2006; Palmer et al., 2016). Conversely, the effect on mental health is more acute in the short run, but the longer the conflict continues, the more likely it is that people will adjust to their new situation (Shemyakina and Plagnol, 2013; Miller and Rasmussen, 2010). Previous studies point out that the spread of communicable diseases arising from forced migration flows during conflict increases a number of chronic diseases and disabilities (Toole and Waldman, 1997; Roberts et al., 2017). As an indicator of changes in physical health, we use self-reports as to whether a person had a chronic disease within the previous 12 months. To measure mental health, we employ self-reports about stress symptoms within the previous 12 months. Physical responses to stress can be reflected in a set of symptoms (anxiety, depression, insomnia, migraine, etc.; Farhood et al., 1993). The dependent variable for the basic model is constructed based on the responses to a set of questions concerning whether the person had any symptoms of stress. To avoid difficulties with correspondence and to have a reasonable share of cases, all questions that measure any symptoms of stress (namely, frequent headaches and migraine, depression and anxiety, and hypertension) are aggregated into one category – stress symptoms – as the simple average of the three components. More detailed definitions of the health variables are given inTable A1in Appendix A.</p>
<p>To sum up, it shall be stated that in the case of Ukrainian war refugees, all of the above-mentioned risk factors may occur. The Ukrainians fleeing the war are exposed to war trauma, evacuation trauma, acculturation trauma and media trauma (McDonnell et al., 2022; Rizzi et al., 2022; Javanbakht, 2022). Stress among refugees is increased by the uncertainty about their future (Newnham et al., 2019). Part of the Ukrainian refugees experienced previous trauma which had been given rise by the necessity to leave their former place of residence as a result of Russian military activities taking place in the east of Ukraine since 2014 (Johnson et al., 2021 ; Długosz et al., 2022 ). Trauma is observed among both internally and externally displaced refugees (Leon et al., 2022).</p>

<section id="measuring-war-experience" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="measuring-war-experience">3.3 Measuring War Experience</h2>
<p>More intense and more recent exposure to violence are more likely to generate a triggerability in risk preference.</p>
<p>The problem of the well-being and mental health of societies during a period of crisis – in particular, war – is currently viewed and reported on in a vast body of literature from a variety of perspectives. Specific attention is addressed towards physical well-being (Cheung et al., 2020; Jahanshahi et al., 2020; Osiichuk &amp; Shepotylo, 2020), mental wellbeing (Jahanshahi et al., 2020; Kurapov et al., 2022c; Mohd Saleem et al., 2021; Pavlenko et al., 2022; Rizkalla &amp; Segal, 2018), financial well-being (Osiichuk &amp; Shepotylo, 2020), and social well-being (Barchielli et al., 2022; Bragin et al., 2021; Jahanshahi et al., 2020; Kurapov et al., 2022; Kurapov et al., 2022a). As reported, physical well-being has two dimensions: physical welfare (Cheung et al., 2020) and physical health (Jahanshahi et al., 2020). In particular, it has been found that public access to physical goods, such as housing, food, etc., significantly declines during war-related crises, as has been confirmed by exploring the welfare and quality of life of those affected by the Syrian conflict (Cheung et al., 2020). The impact of military conflicts on physical health is evident but not comprehensively covered in the literature, even though researchers highlight the negative relationship between these variables (Jahanshahi et al., 2020; Osiichuk &amp; Shepotylo, 2020). Much attention is dedicated to the adverse impact of war and other related crises on overall well-being and metal health – in particular, financial health, which suffers significantly. Researchers outline the general deterioration of the financial well-being of citizens in short- and long-term perspectives (Osiichuk &amp; Shepotylo, 2020), and the lack of proper access to regular social benefits (Hendrickx et al., 2019). Other negative consequences of war include the deterioration of general social well-being (Bragin et al., 2021; Jahanshahi et al., 2020), the reduction of social support (Cheung et al., 2020), the inability to maintain previously-established social relationships, the use of habitualized behavioral coping strategies (Kurapov et al., 2022a), and the emergence and further maintenance of discrimination against social minorities and other vulnerable social groups (Mohd Saleem et al., 2021).</p>
<p>In order to meaningfully measure experience of war it is important to break it down into 2 categories: objective and subjective. (Papadopoulos 2021) also about involuntary dislocation The prevailing mental health issue during the post-war period is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (references). While trauma can be a devastating experience, it is important to recognize that it can also be an opportunity for growth and transformation. PTG is often associated with the concept of resilience, which refers to the ability to bounce back from adversity. While resilience is an important trait to have, PTG takes it one step further by suggesting that individuals can actually benefit from traumatic experiences in unexpected ways (Dell’Osso et al., 2022; Jin et al., 2014). However, not everyone is affected by war the same way: some bounce back and exhibit positive psychological changes that can occur after experiencing a traumatic event, which are referred to as Post Traumatic Stress (PTG). It was found that people living in war-torn areas exhibit moderate levels of PTG. Women are more prone to PTG than men; younger and older participants show higher levels of PTG, while middle-aged participants exhibit lower levels; and financial security increases PTG. Presence in Ukraine increases personal strength, while living outside of Ukraine increases the possibilities for new PTG strategies. Trauma exposure during the war does not increase levels of PTG Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) (“FROM TRAUMA TO TRANSFORMATION: PREDICTORS OF POST-TRAUMATIC GROWTH IN UKRAINIANS AFFECTED BY WAR IN AN ONGOING CONFLICT SETTING,” n.d.) Objective experience is what the person has actually experienced: forced relocation, property damage, loss of a friend/family member, physical damage… - something that has actually happened. And might and mightn’t affect the person. There exists multiple measures of . One frequently used is The Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5) - a self-report measure designed to screen for potentially traumatic events in a respondent’s lifetime. There are also WEQ (Karam et al.&nbsp;1999) These questionnaires involve the usual combat experiences (being “under the enemy fire”, “surrounded by the enemy”, “witnessed killing of others”, etc.) like in the Combat Exposure Scale with 7 questions19; witnessing of bizarre death or mutilation (Military Stress Scale with 6 questions 20; Combat Exposure Index with 7 questions21); killing of civilians (another instrument under the same name – Combat Exposure Scale with 7 questions22). Some questionnaires (Vietnam Era Stress Inventory23, Women’s Wartime Stressor Scale24) comprise questions about unpleasant experiences in the military setting (sleep and/or food deprivation, lack of support, reproach and offences upon return home). Most of the above questionnaires represent the brief scales assessing the stressors specific to war zone and some of them have good measures of reliability (as measured by Cronbach’s alpha) A special problem in assessing stressor exposure is accuracy and authenticity of the retrospective reports provided by the subjects. The researcher’s goal is to ‘’minimize the probability that client’s reports are incorrect and maximize the likelihood of the completeness of his reports’ One thing we can’t neglect is frequency and intensity of exposure. People who have experienced sirens in Zakarpaska region have had much less of an exposure than those in Zaporizhzha. In addition to those in Zakarpatska , the siren is merely a warning to them, while those living closer to the frontline might view sirens as a threat. However this won’t fully capture the effect these events had on the person. For this we must measure how these events affected the person in question. Since objectively terrible events can have different effects on people, some, despite the suffering they’ve endured reassess their life and report growth (Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG)), however with this measure we can’t say what their condition were before the war and wheather this growtsh</p>
