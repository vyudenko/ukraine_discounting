*Background and motivation of this work.*

1.  How the full scale war has started and has an impact on Ukrainians
2.  What is discounting and why is it important?
3.  Research question and methodology recap
4.  Key findings

Ukraine is experiencing a complex socioeconomic and political situation, complicated by the ongoing conflict in Donbas, military events that began on February 24, 2022, a total blackout, migration does not stop, families have lost loved ones, housing - tens of thousands of people were forced to move to other countries or safer regions.
More than half Ukrainians report that their financial situation has deteriorated [@pres-rel; @pravoviy], some have lost have everything: their home, business, livelihood.
The income situation is worse among residents of the south and east, middle-aged people, the poor and low-income, as well as those who have lost their jobs or work part-time.
Now, the situation could become even worse if massive bombing of the critical infrastructure continues this autumn.

"Every day, the number of people who will experience consequences for their mental health will increase. Even those who were able to withstand the first months of the war will suffer mental exhaustion because getting used to being in a constant war can also harm mental health. According to our preliminary forecаsts at the moment of the wаr, about 15 million Ukrаinians will need psychologicаl support in the future, of which about 3-4 million will need to be prescribed medical treatment," said Minister of Health Viktor Liashko, presenting the results of the express audit of services for the mental health care provided by state authorities (Liashko, 2022).

Loss of life, loss of home, forced relocaion, economic losses due to workers leaving...

2.  Where does the discounting come in

Ukrainians are living in unprecedented times.
War has ravaged the country and it consequences will be far reaching and long lasting.
Some of these consequence will have to do with people's attitudes towards future.
Living under constant threat of could make one live in the moment and don't plan too much ahead, as the future might not come.
People value the present more over future.
This phenomenon in behavioral economics is called time discounting[^1] and it is linked with many life outcomes.
And the realities of Ukraine is that \<migrants, people becoming poorer, disabled, economy is destroyed, uncertainty is as high as ever\> all of which affect people's daily choices.
However we know that long-term growth require forward-looking and more patient behavior.

[^1]: In behavioral economic literature there are multiple names for the same phenomena: temporal discounting, delay discounting, intertemporal discounting.
    Present paper uses these interchangeably.

The literature is clear on military conflict's effect on mental health [@trujillo2021], financial situation and discounting [@imas2015]....
But [@imas2015] studies only one aspect of temporal discounting - present bias.
In our study the phenomenon of temporal discounting will be studied through the lens of 4 temporal discounting types: magnitude effect, delay-speedup asymmetry, gain-loss asymmetry, and present bias.

We want to study how war, through its many manifestations, affects Ukrainian's temporal discounting.

*Summarize the proposed approach (methodology you use) to the problem and the results*

Given a vast complexity of war experiences, in order to establish the effect of war we would have to consider multiple perspectives: influence on mental health, financial situation.
War doesn't directly affect temporal discounting, it does so through other processes like perception of one's safety, physical and mental health, financial situation.[^2]

[^2]: It is not "Because of my war experience I started discounting future more", but "Because war affected my physical/mental health, and financial situation, I now value the present more (discount future more)"

In this paper we combine tools from economics and psychology, namely MCQ [@ruggeri2022], and SF-12 [@ware1996] to analyze the relationship between potentially traumatic experiences and temporal discounting.
War related questions are taken from here [@fleeing]

1.  What is temporal discounting and which studies are relevant and why
2.  Studies on Temporal discounting and mental health

5.  Our contribution

Temporal discounting is the current relative valuation placed on receiving a good or some cash at an earlier date compared with receiving it at a later date [@loewenstein].
This tendency is often treated as a behavioral anomaly measured by presenting a series of choices that vary values, timelines, framing (for example, gains or losses) and other trade-offs.
Responses to these series of lottery questions can be aggregated or indexed in ways that test different manifestations of the anomaly or the threshold at which individuals are willing to change their preferences.
Individuals vary in their responses to intertemporal choice, and their revealed discount rates can be used in predicting behavior across other domains.
(which domains with examples)

[@loewenstein] lay the foundation of researching anomalies of choice associated with Discounted Utility Theorem.
They systematize previous studies and provide methodology for assessing each anomaly: magnitude, gain--loss asymmetry, delay--speedup asymmetry, common difference.
Drawing upon [@loewenstein] paper [@ruggeri2022] tested generalizability of temporal discounting in 61 countries using 5 choice anomalies.

[@imas2015] finds differences in discounting between exposed and unexposed individuals, and that this difference is driven by present bias impulsivity and present bias.

[@voors2012] conducted a series of field experiments in rural Burundi to examine the impact of exposure to conflict on social, risk, and time preferences.
They find that individuals exposed to violence are more altruistic, more risk-seeking, and have higher discounting.
However, in the end they report that the **net effect of exposure to violence is unclear**, because on the one hand it encourages risk-taking and increases the prosocial behavior, on the other hand it also triggers impatience, which discourages savings and investments.

[@cassar2017] study trust, risk, and time preferences after a tsunami in Thailand.
Similarly to [@voors2012], they find that the 2004 tsunami has led to substantial long lasting increases in risk aversion, prosocial behavior, and impatience.
In assessing tsunamis impact they considered whether the village was affected, whether the individual or household experienced financial damage, and whether a family member was injured or killed.
We will use a similar approach in our paper.

Increased uncertainty

Other studies, like [@kelley2015] show that mortality concerns appear to cause people to value the future more.
In the study participants had to think about their own mortality immediately prior to completing a measure of delay discounting.
Those in treatment group discounted future monetary gains less than did other participants, suggesting that they valued the future more.

*Finally, people may receive help from neighbors, strangers, the government and non-governmental organizations, in addition to giving help to others. All of these manifestations of war affect an individual's choices and preferences. To understand which manifestations can best explain the effect we turn to the relevant literature, discussion of which follows below. Firstly, we look at the papers that take a helicopter look on the topic of time discounting.*

Knowing the potential effects exposure to violence has on human decision making we needed now to apply this insight in our survey, specifically in the Monetary Choice Questionnaire.
For this we need to figure out a benchmark - which monetary amount will be salient for our responders, a discount rate, and a time frame.
There are many studies that find various discount rates for different time periods and amounts (see (Frederick and Loewenstein 2002) for a review).
In general, shorter time periods are associated with higher rates of observed discounting.
(Ruggeri et al. 2022) uses 10% of median salary as a benchmark, 10% discounting rate and "now-12 months-24 months" time frame.
While this study involved Ukraine in 2021, using the same percentage and time will not yield valuable results for us.
To understand conditions facing Ukrainians right now, we turn to a paper on Argentina and Britain (Macchia, Plagnol, and Reimers 2018), in which authors use inflation rate in both countries (Britain - low, Argentina - high inflation) to study people's sensitivity with regards to delay discounting choices.
Another study in Zimbabwe (Larochelle, Alwang, and Taruvinga 2014) provides an extreme account of hyperinflation and how it affects people's wellbeing.
As the Russo-Ukrainian war is the most televised war of recent years, we thought about looking into the use of social media and how it relates with discounting.
(Shenhav, Rand, and Greene 2017) in their study of temporal discounting found that people who with steeper discounting prefer to consume information that is less complex and multi-faceted, and use short-form social media (e.g. Twitter).
Our contribution will lie in explaining how various experiences of war affect people's discounting and financial decision making.

By combining a wide range of indicators (variables) that are related to the current experiences of war by Ukrainians, this paper aims to investigate which manifestations of war have the highest effect on temporal discounting.

# Chapter 3. Methodology

\<make explanations of hypotheses shorter\>

There are several channels through which war experience could affect individual preferences.
One plausible channel would be through a large negative shock to wealth or income, which in turn would alter preferences.
A second channel, connected to the previous one is increased uncertainty, which also affects preferences.
A third channel, from the psychology literature, would be through worsened mental and physical health, which are often associated with higher discounting rates.
Any or all of these possibilities could affect individual's preferences.
A range of research gives the expectation that war experiences could affect preferences in these ways.
Here, we review the literature as we describe our predictions for the war's effects on preferences.

### H1. [Exposure to war experiences]{.underline} is positively associated with temporal discounting

First is that individual preferences are affected in many ways in which person "experiences" war.
For example, physical damage to oneself, family or friends; property damage; loss of a relative or a close one; living in fear, witnessing death, suffering, forced evacuation, blackout etc.
All these manifestations may have different impact on people.
A psychology literature suggests that conflicts and natural disasters alter exposed individuals' risk and time[^3] preferences [@imas2015; @voors2012; @eckel2009; @cassar2017; @willinger].

[^3]: The relationship between risk preferences and time preferences is disputed, some studeis find that they are highly correlated [@willinger; @beine2020], but a recent metastudy [@johnson2020] concludes that this relationship is not as strong .
    Our study doesn't specifically study individual's risk preferences, but still considers finding on risk preferences as relevant to our research.

There are studies that show that there is a positive association between temporal discounting and exposure to violence[^4] [@imas2015; @voors2012].

[^4]: which would be experience of war in our paper.

Prior evidence indicates a weak or insignificant relationship between violence and a measure of time preferences, but in those studies all intertemporal choices were only made between options in the future.
[@callen2015]finds that individuals affected by a tsunami in Sri Lanka become more patient over the long-run.
[@voors2012] finds that living in an area where a negative event or violence occurred has a weak effect on time preferences.
This last study measured exposure to violence on the community level, and individuals who may have seen violence indirectly or not at all were classified as exposed.
Additionally, they examined time preferences over outcomes that all lay in the future, and in turn could not identify an effect on present bias separate from exponential discounting.

### H2. Negative financial shock is positively associated with discounting

War brings about destruction.
Even people not directly affected by war (not involved in combat or experiencing bombing...), may suffer from its consequences.
Military violence doesn't just affect the mental health of civilians living in conflict zones [@cesur2013], but also of those who experience it through daily stressors such as changes in physical health and financial situation, the destruction of social networks and the mass displacement of the civilian population [@miller2010].

Despite the ongoing war subjective evaluation of one's financial wellbeing has barely changed and is on the pre-invasion level [@pres-rel].
This could have multiple explanation: a) overall level has decreased more than for individuals (everyone experiences blackouts, cuts in salaries...)[^5].
[@m.o.2021] supports this.

[^5]: That is if it is just me who got poorer than I would significantly change my financial attitudes, if everyone (around me) became poorer than I wouldn't feel it as strongly - they have it just as bad after all.

People with low incomes exhibit higher temporal discounting compared to richer people, i.e., they are more likely to prefer smaller and sooner over larger and later payments.
Because of war, many people may experience negative financial shock, which would alter their preferences and they will be more tempted to pick sooner smaller option.

[@ruggeri2022] indicates that anyone facing a negative financial environment---even with a better income within that environment---is likely to make decisions that prioritize immediate clarity over future uncertainty.

[@haushofer] finds that negative income shocks lead to an increase in discounting; specifically, they exacerbate present bias, the tendency to overvalue the present relative to the future.
Conversely, positive income shocks weakly decrease discounting.
In contrast, high vs. low levels of income in the absence of shocks do not affect discounting.

[@mellis2018] in their paper asked participants to think about neutral (job transfer) or negative income shock (losing hob) before completing a task on delay discounting.
Narratives of negative income shock increased delay discounting compared to control narratives.

[@bufe2022] finds that experience of an income shock between survey waves was associated with a large decline in subjective financial well-being, while the experience of an expense shock was associated with a more modest decline.

### H3. Poor mental health is associated with higher discounting

... hose who survive, exposure to violence and other trauma has been shown to affect behavior and lead to costly, suboptimal decision-making long after the negative event has passed.
These second-order effects of exposure to violence are likely dwarfed by the direct effects in the immediate aftermath, but in the long run, they are part of what determines when and how recovery occurs.
If violence changes people's preferences, it will also change the effects of policies implemented on behalf of those people.
Research in psychology has demonstrated that exposure to violence and other trauma (e.g. extreme poverty) has complex, deleterious long-run effects on both mental and physical health (Boscarino, 2006; Yehuda, 2006).

There have been a vast literature on the effects of natural disasters on choice preferences (Eckel, El-Gamal, and Wilson 2009; Cassar, Healy, and Von Kessler 2017), and some relevant studies on effect of armed conflict experience on, for example, risk aversion in South Korea [@kim2014] , social, risk and time preferences in Burundi (Voors et al. 2012), and on happiness in Ukraine (Coupe and Obrizan 2016).
Some studies report that mental health affects discounting \_\_\_\_\_, others that it doesn't Subjective mental health has been shown to be positively associated with discounting (Löckenhoff, O'Donoghue, and Dunning 2011) In the context of ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War, studying intertemporal choices of people affected by war can help in creation of policy decisions that will mitigate negative repercussions of exposure to violence and destruction.
This is important, because any effects conflict might have on risk aversion, time discounting, or trusting behavior, could substantially affect how people are able to recover from conflicts..
In other words, exposure to violence impacts communities not only through the direct losses they inflict, like physical damage or seizure/destruction of business, but also through people's willingness to attempt new business ventures, to save, and to work cooperatively.
In this research we want to study intertemporal choices of Ukrainians 1.5 years after the onset of full-scale invasion as it relates to experience of war, media usage, and trust in media.

The extent to which individuals discount the future and whether they discount in a time consistent fashion is an important determinant of their life outcomes.
The topic of war effects on mental, physical and financial health has been thoroughly examined.
(list papers) In particular ....
<list subtopic and papers>

However there hasn't been enough papers focusing on how war affects temporal discounting.

# Chapter 4. Data

\<make Measuring sections brief\>

To study the hypotheses we conduct a survey largely adapted from multiple papers.
Questions on temporal discounting are adapted from [@ruggeri2022], mental health - [@ware1996], and war experiences - [@fleeing].
First respondents answer a set of adaptive MCQ, then questions on financial situation, followed questions about mental health, war experiences, and finish with a set of socio-demographic questions.

Below, we describe each of our experimental treatments in detail.
Complete experimental instructions can be found in the Appendix.

## 4.1 Measuring Temporal Discounting

To measure temporal discounting and we mostly follow @ruggeri2022, in which not only the temporal discounting is measured, but its anomalies: sign effect (gain/loss asymmetry), magnitude effect, delay/speedup asymmetry and present bias.

The procedure is as follows.
All participants begin with choosing either approximately 10% of the national monthly household income average immediately, or 130% of that value in 12 months.
This translated into 2000 UAH immediately or 2600 UAH in 3 months.
Participants who chose the immediate option were shown the same option set, but the delayed value was now 135% (2700 UAH).
If they continued to prefer the immediate option, a final option offered 140% (2800 UAH) as the delayed reward.
If participants chose the delayed option initially, subsequent choices were 125% (2500 UAH) and 120% (2400 UAH).
This progression was then inverted for losses, with the same values presented as payments, increasing for choosing delayed and decreasing for choosing immediate.
Finally, the original gain set was repeated using 50% of the average monthly income to represent higher-magnitude choices.

Assessing temporal choice patterns was done in three ways.
First, the three baseline scenarios to determine preferences for immediate or delayed gains (at two magnitudes) and losses (one).
Second, the proportion of participants who exhibited the theoretically described anomaly for each anomaly scenario was calculated.
We also calculated proportions of participants who exhibited inconsistent decisions even if not specifically aligned with one of the defined anomalies.
Finally, we computed a discounting score based on responses to all choice items, ranging from 0 (always prefer delayed gains or earlier losses) to n (always prefer immediate gains or delayed losses).
The score then represents the consistency of discounting behaviours, irrespective of the presence of other choice anomalies.

In adapting these questions from [@ruggeri2022], several aspects were addressed.

1.  Because of uncertainty people would prefer immediate gains and delayed losses no-matter-the-amount
2.  Because of uncertainty people would choose sooner smaller options if the delayed option is too far into the future

First, the baseline amount was set to 2000 UAH, because studies like [@green1997] find that as the value of hypothetical gain decreases, so does the temporal discounting.
That is why we wanted to make choices salient.
Future choices should also be salient - respondents should feel that there is additional value in waiting.

Second, we have set the perios to 3 months.
As it should strike the balance between uncertain future and relaively certain present.

Full list of questions on temporal discounting can be found in Appendix

## 4.2 Measuring Financial Circumstances

To measure financial well-being, we use both objective and subjective aspects.
Objective FWB is captured by answers to

as the real total household income -- the sum of all household income sources net of taxes and deflated by the consumer price index.
To evaluate subjective FWB, we use two self-reported variables.
The first variable is the "ability to make ends meet" ("AEM"), which is very commonly used to measure financial well-being (Angel et al., 2003; Arber et al., 2014).
It takes a value of 1 if the person had enough income to buy food and 0 otherwise.
RLMS does not contain questions that can be used to measure this ability to make ends meet.
Thus, for the Russian sample we use a variable that measures "financial satisfaction", which is also used as an indicator of subjective financial well-being in other studies (i.e. Zimmerman, 1995).
It takes a value of 1 if the person is satisfied and 0 otherwise.
To evaluate how secure a person feels about their financial future, we use the self-reported "expectation about financial well-being" ("FWB").
It takes a value of 1 if the person expects improvements and 0 otherwise.
More detailed information about these measures is presented in Table A1in Appendix A. We distinguish between subjective FWB and income, because income alone does not reflect the ability to meet one's needs (Zimmerman and Katon, 2005) and has a different dynamic to expectations about the financial situation (Angel et al., 2003; Joo and Grable, 2004).
Current real income varies with short-term fluctuations in prices and economic activity.

Debts are related to intertemporal discounting [@ikeda2015]

## 4.3 Measuring Mental Health

As per the findings of various academic publications, it has been established that the impact of war on mental health and well-being is notably negative, resulting in the manifestation of a range of psychological disorders such as PTSD, depression (Charlson et al., 2019; Gonçalves Júnior et al., 2022; Hendrickx et al., 2019; Osokina et al., 2022; Perkins et al., 2018), and suicidal ideation (Gonçalves Júnior et al., 2022)

Studies of the health of Ukrainian children and adolescents have confirmed that the risk of developing symptoms of depression exists both during the war and in the post-war period (Gonçalves Júnior et al., 2022; Osokina et al., 2022) According to Gonçalves Júnior et al. (2022), military conflicts also worsen the psycho-emotional state of war-affected populations, resulting in negative feelings such as sadness, anger, guilt, or loneliness.

As there are no feasible ways to measure objective health, we measure subjective health with SF-12 (Ware, Kosinski, and Keller 1996), a widely used and well-validated measure which yields separate scores for mental and physical health.
Multiple-choice and Likert-type items require participants to rate their general health as well as aspects of mental well-being and functional health.
This index was used in relevant research and has shown good results (Löckenhoff, O'Donoghue, and Dunning 2011)

Regarding health, we make a distinction between physical and mental health, because we expect the conflict's effect on them to be subject to different mechanisms, timing and duration.
The effect on physical health may develop later, but with longer and more severe effects, leading to disabilities and chronic diseases (Alderman et al., 2006; Palmer et al., 2016).
Conversely, the effect on mental health is more acute in the short run, but the longer the conflict continues, the more likely it is that people will adjust to their new situation (Shemyakina and Plagnol, 2013; Miller and Rasmussen, 2010).
Previous studies point out that the spread of communicable diseases arising from forced migration flows during conflict increases a number of chronic diseases and disabilities (Toole and Waldman, 1997; Roberts et al., 2017).
As an indicator of changes in physical health, we use self-reports as to whether a person had a chronic disease within the previous 12 months.
To measure mental health, we employ self-reports about stress symptoms within the previous 12 months.
Physical responses to stress can be reflected in a set of symptoms (anxiety, depression, insomnia, migraine, etc.; Farhood et al., 1993).
The dependent variable for the basic model is constructed based on the responses to a set of questions concerning whether the person had any symptoms of stress.
To avoid difficulties with correspondence and to have a reasonable share of cases, all questions that measure any symptoms of stress (namely, frequent headaches and migraine, depression and anxiety, and hypertension) are aggregated into one category -- stress symptoms -- as the simple average of the three components.
More detailed definitions of the health variables are given inTable A1in Appendix A.

To sum up, it shall be stated that in the case of Ukrainian war refugees, all of the above-mentioned risk factors may occur.
The Ukrainians fleeing the war are exposed to war trauma, evacuation trauma, acculturation trauma and media trauma (McDonnell et al., 2022; Rizzi et al., 2022; Javanbakht, 2022).
Stress among refugees is increased by the uncertainty about their future (Newnham et al., 2019).
Part of the Ukrainian refugees experienced previous trauma which had been given rise by the necessity to leave their former place of residence as a result of Russian military activities taking place in the east of Ukraine since 2014 (Johnson et al., 2021 ; Długosz et al., 2022 ).
Trauma is observed among both internally and externally displaced refugees (Leon et al., 2022).

## 4.4 Measuring War Experience

More intense and more recent exposure to violence are more likely to generate a triggerability in risk preference.

In studying intertemporal choices during wartime there are multiple things to keep in mind.
Experience of war is complex and it is hard to accurately define and measure it.

The problem of the well-being and mental health of societies during a period of crisis -- in particular, war -- is currently viewed and reported on in a vast body of literature from a variety of perspectives.
Specific attention is addressed towards physical well-being [@osiichuk2020] (Cheung et al., 2020; Jahanshahi et al., 2020; Osiichuk & Shepotylo, 2020), mental wellbeing (Jahanshahi et al., 2020; Kurapov et al., 2022c; Mohd Saleem et al., 2021; Pavlenko et al., 2022; Rizkalla & Segal, 2018), financial well-being (Osiichuk & Shepotylo, 2020), and social well-being (Barchielli et al., 2022; Bragin et al., 2021; Jahanshahi et al., 2020; Kurapov et al., 2022; Kurapov et al., 2022a).
As reported, physical well-being has two dimensions: physical welfare (Cheung et al., 2020) and physical health (Jahanshahi et al., 2020).
In particular, it has been found that public access to physical goods, such as housing, food, etc., significantly declines during war-related crises, as has been confirmed by exploring the welfare and quality of life of those affected by the Syrian conflict (Cheung et al., 2020).
The impact of military conflicts on physical health is evident but not comprehensively covered in the literature, even though researchers highlight the negative relationship between these variables (Jahanshahi et al., 2020; Osiichuk & Shepotylo, 2020).
Much attention is dedicated to the adverse impact of war and other related crises on overall well-being and metal health -- in particular, financial health, which suffers significantly.
Researchers outline the general deterioration of the financial well-being of citizens in short- and long-term perspectives (Osiichuk & Shepotylo, 2020), and the lack of proper access to regular social benefits (Hendrickx et al., 2019).
Other negative consequences of war include the deterioration of general social well-being (Bragin et al., 2021; Jahanshahi et al., 2020), the reduction of social support (Cheung et al., 2020), the inability to maintain previously-established social relationships, the use of habitualized behavioral coping strategies (Kurapov et al., 2022a), and the emergence and further maintenance of discrimination against social minorities and other vulnerable social groups (Mohd Saleem et al., 2021).

In order to meaningfully measure experience of war it is important to break it down into 2 categories: objective and subjective.
[@papadopoulos2021] also about involuntary dislocation

The prevailing mental health issue during the post-war period is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (references).
While trauma can be a devastating experience, it is important to recognize that it can also be an opportunity for growth and transformation.
PTG is often associated with the concept of resilience, which refers to the ability to bounce back from adversity.
While resilience is an important trait to have, PTG takes it one step further by suggesting that individuals can actually benefit from traumatic experiences in unexpected ways (Dell'Osso et al., 2022; Jin et al., 2014).
However, not everyone is affected by war the same way: some bounce back and exhibit positive psychological changes that can occur after experiencing a traumatic event, which are referred to as Post Traumatic Stress (PTG).
It was found that people living in war-torn areas exhibit moderate levels of PTG.
Women are more prone to PTG than men; younger and older participants show higher levels of PTG, while middle-aged participants exhibit lower levels; and financial security increases PTG.
Presence in Ukraine increases personal strength, while living outside of Ukraine increases the possibilities for new PTG strategies.
Trauma exposure during the war does not increase levels of PTG Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) ("FROM TRAUMA TO TRANSFORMATION: PREDICTORS OF POST-TRAUMATIC GROWTH IN UKRAINIANS AFFECTED BY WAR IN AN ONGOING CONFLICT SETTING," n.d.) Objective experience is what the person has actually experienced: forced relocation, property damage, loss of a friend/family member, physical damage... - something that has actually happened.
And might and mightn't affect the person.
There exists multiple measures of .
One frequently used is The Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5) - a self-report measure designed to screen for potentially traumatic events in a respondent's lifetime.
There are also WEQ [@karam1999] These questionnaires involve the usual combat experiences (being "under the enemy fire", "surrounded by the enemy", "witnessed killing of others", etc.) like in the Combat Exposure Scale with 7 questions19; witnessing of bizarre death or mutilation (Military Stress Scale with 6 questions 20; Combat Exposure Index with 7 questions21); killing of civilians (another instrument under the same name -- Combat Exposure Scale with 7 questions22).
Some questionnaires (Vietnam Era Stress Inventory23, Women's Wartime Stressor Scale24) comprise questions about unpleasant experiences in the military setting (sleep and/or food deprivation, lack of support, reproach and offences upon return home).
Most of the above questionnaires represent the brief scales assessing the stressors specific to war zone and some of them have good measures of reliability (as measured by Cronbach's alpha) A special problem in assessing stressor exposure is accuracy and authenticity of the retrospective reports provided by the subjects.
The researcher's goal is to ''minimize the probability that client's reports are incorrect and maximize the likelihood of the completeness of his reports' One thing we can't neglect is frequency and intensity of exposure.
People who have experienced sirens in Zakarpaska region have had much less of an exposure than those in Zaporizhzha.
In addition to those in Zakarpatska , the siren is merely a warning to them, while those living closer to the frontline might view sirens as a threat.
However this won't fully capture the effect these events had on the person.
For this we must measure how these events affected the person in question.
Since objectively terrible events can have different effects on people, some, despite the suffering they've endured reassess their life and report growth (Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG)), however with this measure we can't say what their condition were before the war and wheather this growth

(Coupe and Obrizan 2016) look at how war affected happiness in Ukraine.
This paper doesn't study financial decisions and intertemporal discounting, however it was useful in approaching questions about experience of war.
Another paper by the same authors (Coupé and Obrizan 2016) which studies violence and political outcomes in Ukraine allows us to categorize damage caused by war.
